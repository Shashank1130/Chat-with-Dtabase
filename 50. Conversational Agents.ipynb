Deep-frying, stir-frying and steaming are methods introduced from Chinese cuisine.In 2017, seven Thai dishes appeared on a list of the \"World's 50 Best Foods\", an online poll of 35,000 people worldwide by CNN Travel. Thailand had more dishes on the list than any other country: tom yam kung (4th), pad thai (5th), som tam (6th), massaman curry (10th), green curry (19th), Thai fried rice (24th) and nam tok mu (36th).\n",
